# Orbits UI ðŸš€

Orbits UI is a React Component Library which uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) under the hood.

> This project is at a very early stage of development and is nowhere near production ready. Feel free to play around with it, suggest features and contribute :D

# The Goal ðŸŽ¯

The initial vision for Orbits UI was to be just another React Component Library built with Tailwind CSS but then the light bulb went off.

Orbits UI will provide with components, styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) that follow the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) specification for accessiblity. Now, the aim is to make these components highly customizable. Even though the components will have some base styles, those are just to get started with. The developer has the full freedom to customize the styles, as they wish, by passing in compatible Tailwind CSS classnames.

Other than making common component accessible out of the box, we also aim to make it easier to build applications by providing some UI components like Modals, Popovers, Tooltips, Menus etc.
